/**
  * Supports treating a linear sequence of resources as a single resource.
  *
  * A `Hotswap[F, R]` instance is created as a `Resource` and hence, has
  * a lifetime that is scoped by the `Resource`. After creation, a `Resource[F, R]`
  * can be swapped in to the `Hotswap` by calling `swap`. The acquired resource
  * is returned and is finalized when the `Hotswap` is finalized or upon the next
  * call to `swap`, whichever occurs first.
  *
  * For example, the sequence of three resources `r1, r2, r3` are shown in the
  * following diagram:
  *
  * {{{
  * >----- swap(r1) ---- swap(r2) ---- swap(r3) ----X
  * |        |             |             |          |
  * Creation |             |             |          |
  *         r1 acquired    |             |          |
  *                       r2 acquired    |          |
  *                       r1 released   r3 acquired |
  *                                     r2 released |
  *                                                r3 released
  * }}}
  *
  * This class is particularly useful when working with pulls that cycle through
  * resources -- e.g., writing bytes to files, rotating files every N bytes or M seconds.
  * Without `Hotswap`, such pulls leak resources -- on each file rotation, a file handle
  * or at least an internal resource reference accumulates. With `Hotswap`, the `Hotswap`
  * instance is the only registered resource and each file is swapped in to the `Hotswap`.
  *
  * Usage typically looks something like:
  *
  * {{{
  * Stream.resource(Hotswap(mkResource)).flatMap { case (hotswap, r) =>
  *   // Use r, call hotswap.swap(mkResource) as necessary
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * See `fs2.io.file.writeRotate` for an example of usage.

    * If there are no further calls to `swap`, the resource created by
    * the last call will be finalized when the lifetime of
    * this `Hotswap` (which is itself tracked by `Resource`) is over.
    *
    * Since `swap` closes the old resource immediately, you need to
    * ensure that no code is using the old `R` when `swap` is called.
    * Failing to do so is likely to result in an error on the
    * _consumer_ side. In any case, no resources will be leaked by
    * `swap`.
    *
    * If you try to call swap after the lifetime of this `Hotswap` is
    * over, `swap` will fail, but it will ensure all resources are
    * closed, and never leak any.
